	 * program pseudo code for counting the number of vowels in a string by seperate static methods
		1.	Declare the main method.
		2.	Create a Scanner object named scanner.
		3.	Prompt the user to enter a string.
		4.	Read the user's input string and store it in inputString.
		5.	Define a method named countVowels that takes a string parameter and returns an integer.
		6.	Convert the input string to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
		7.	Initialize a count variable to zero.
		8.	Iterate through each character in the lowercase string.
		9.	Check if the current character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u) and increment the count if true.
		10.	Return the final count.
		11.	Call the countVowels method, passing inputString, and store the result in vowelCount.
		12.	Calculate consonant count by subtracting vowelCount from the length of inputString.
		13.	Display the number of vowels and consonants to the console.
